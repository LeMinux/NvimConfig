This is my neovim config for having an IDE look but also keeping it minimal

If you want neovim to work with a clipboard you may need to install another
package such as X11 clipboard (xclip) or wayland clipboard (wl-clipboard). Use
what ever fits your environment

If you installed neovim with the apt repository it might be outdated and not have
lua support. You can download neovim directly from their github -> https://github.com/neovim/neovim.
